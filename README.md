Blue-Key

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce all of my analysis on Florida Blue Key. The code is entirely in R, and utilizes various packages that require download before use. 

Before reproducing, you should probably download the datasets, which are either on UF's website or hosted here. 

If you have any other ideas or visualizations you'd like to see, reach out to me at tylerjrichards@gmail.com and we'll see what we can do.
